## Description

A python discord bot to help you manage your **Axie Infinity** scholarships.  
This is based on my other Axie project : [Pyaxie](https://github.com/vmercadi/pyaxie) which is a python lib to interact with Axie world.

If you don't have the API URL for Axies informations, some of the functionalities will not work.  
You will have to find this by yourself and then add it in secret.yaml as it is forbidden to make it public in Axie ToS.

If you encounter a problem or have a question, you can join the discord server : https://discord.gg/gqaSv2PZbF

## [Follow this step-by-step guide to install and use the bot](https://github.com/vmercadi/pyaxie-bot/wiki)

As I'm adding a bit every day, you'll have to update the project as much as you can (infos in the discord).  
Here is a command to easily update : `mv secret.yaml asecret.yaml; git pull; mv asecret.yaml secret.yaml`
With this command, you'll not have to write the config in secret.yaml again
